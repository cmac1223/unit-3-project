# trivia-trainer 

Trivia Trainer is an MEAN-STACK (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and Node.js)  app with three models using full CRUD on one model.  We created an app that will allow the user to properly prepare for any Trivia Night event they will partake in.   The user will start off by logging in basic his or basic information to create a new user or if they are a previous user they can locate their username in order to find their study guide list.  The study guide list allows the user to access any study guide they choose to study from. Each study guide has a list of questions and answers that the user can save and reference them later for studying. There is a trivia model that will render random trivia questions and answers, the user can use this model as an additional study tool. This project was split up between a team of three. Chris McClain, Christy Bartholomew, and Clark Waite.
